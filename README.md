# Introduction :bulb:

CG-Ellipse-Transformation

This project was made for computer graphics class in Unip-Campinas-Brazil.

Rotation, scaling, projection and shear mapping all in one. Geometry at best!

# About :blue_book:

Computer graphics is an area related a lot, and I mean A LOT with geometry. Because of that, many concepts can be found in both of the subjects.

In here you will find some exemples of linear transformations such as rotation, scaling and shearing. At the end you will find one more transformation (not linear) that is translation. All made in Java

# Objetives :clipboard:
In this project you will find implementations of:
   
   * Rotation based on center of figure
   * Scaling 
   * Shear
   * Translation

# Run Locally :open_file_folder:
To run this project locally first you will need to install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and a Java editor from your preference. I suggest using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org).
After go to your [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) or other terminal of your preference and type:

    git clone https://github.com/ofelipescherer/CG-Ellipse-Transformation.git

In Eclipse, find the src/tests folder and just run whatever you want.
