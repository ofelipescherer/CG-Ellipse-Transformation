# Run Locally :open_file_folder:
To run this project locally first you will need to install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and a Java editor from your preference. I suggest using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org).
After go to your [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) or other terminal of your preference and type:
